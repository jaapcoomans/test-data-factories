# Fairies, Fakers and Factories: Boost your tests with better test data

This project is a simple demo belonging to my conference talk "Fairies, Fakers and Factories" which I've presented at Devoxx UK 2021 and J-Fall 2021.

The application is incomplete and limited to just a couple of domain classes for a Call for Papers application.
The main purpose is to demonstrate how Java-faker can be used to create Test Data Factories for unit tests.

## Test Data Factories
The project currently contains 2 Test Data Factories:
* [PaperTestDataFactory](src/test/java/nl/jaapcoomans/demo/testdata/conference/domain/PaperTestDataFactory.java)
* [SpeakerTestDataFactory](src/test/java/nl/jaapcoomans/demo/testdata/conference/domain/SpeakerTestDataFactory.java)
